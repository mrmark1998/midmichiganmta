**Mid-Michigan Music Teachers Association Official Website**

A website I created in 2020 for the official music teachers assocation in the mid-Michigan area.  I created it from scratch using Wordpress and Bluehost.  Later, I heavily modified using advanced CSS, JS, and HTML code.  Continuing work included creating user profiles, blogs, event lists, and helping members with technical issues.  This was much upgraded from the previous version back in 2018.  Please follow the link to view the website:

Short profile about the club:

The activities of the Mid-Michigan MTA are for charitable purposes, in order to promote and encourage the understanding, appreciation, and study of the art of music, and to elevate the economic and artistic standards of teachers of music and to promote a closer professional community.
