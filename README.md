A website I heavily modified using Wordpress plug-ins and advanced CSS, JS, and HTML code.  Much upgraded from the previous version back in 2018.  Please follow the link to view the website:

Short about regarding the club:

Mid-Michigan MTA (M3TA) is an organization of music teachers who live in and around Midland, Michigan. The activities of the Mid-Michigan MTA are for charitable purposes, in order to promote and encourage the understanding, appreciation, and study of the art of music, and to elevate the economic and artistic standards of teachers of music and to promote a closer professional community.
